## Overview

Reverse mathematics analyzes which subsystems of second-order arithmetic are exactly strong enough to prove given theorems. A central part of this landscape is the chain
\[
\mathrm{RCA} < \mathrm{WWKL} < \mathrm{WKL},
\]
where RCA formalizes computable mathematics, WWKL brings in a measure-theoretic version of weak König’s lemma, and WKL corresponds to the usual compactness-style weak König’s lemma.

This thesis gives an expository but detailed proof that the hierarchy above is strict. On the **RCA < WWKL** side, I develop the background in computability, Turing degrees, and algorithmic randomness needed to show that WWKL proves the existence of Martin-Löf random reals in certain positive-measure Π\(^0_1\) classes, whereas RCA cannot. On the **WWKL < WKL** side, I present the Yu–Simpson construction of an ω-model that satisfies WWKL yet fails WKL, via a carefully built Turing ideal closed under randomness extensions.

Conceptually, the thesis is about how **computability**, **measure**, and **randomness** interact to separate foundational systems: WWKL is strong enough to guarantee random reals and measure-theoretic arguments, but still too weak to recover the full compactness power of WKL.

## Structure

Roughly, the thesis is organized as follows:

1. **Background and Preliminaries**  
   - Turing machines, partial computable functions, Turing reducibility, and Turing degrees  
   - Algorithmic randomness and Martin-Löf tests  
   - Basic measure theory (Lebesgue measure, null sets)  
   - Reverse mathematics and the subsystem framework

2. **RCA < WWKL**  
   - Construction of a nonempty Π\(^0_1\) class of positive measure containing only Martin-Löf random reals  
   - Explanation of why RCA cannot prove such a class has an element, while WWKL can

3. **WWKL < WKL**  
   - Construction of an ω-model as a Turing ideal generated by iteratively adding sets that are random over the previous stage  
   - Proof that this model satisfies WWKL (every positive-measure tree has a path in the model)  
   - Proof that the same model fails WKL, via inseparable r.e. sets and the equivalence of WKL with Σ\(^0_1\)-separation
